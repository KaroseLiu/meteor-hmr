# Boilerplates and Examples

If you're looking to get up and running quickly on a new project, these might help.  They include everything all set up for you so you can get straight to work without wasting time on common setups.

NB: Don't pick a boilerplate or copy-and-paste parts of one blindly.  It's important to understand what each boilerplate offers you and that you agree with and *understand* the various choices made by their authors.

* **[mantra-sample-blog-app-hot](https://github.com/gadicc/mantra-sample-blog-app-hot)**

  If you're developing in line with the Mantra spec, you're probably familiar with the original `mantra-sample-blog-app`.  This project contains the [minimal set of changes needed](https://github.com/gadicc/mantra-sample-blog-app-hot/compare/master...gadicc:hot) from the original to get React hotloading working.

* **[priezz/meteor-react-hot](https://gitlab.com/priezz/meteor-react-hot.git)**

  Here is the Meteor boilerplate for React development. Features:

  * easy load all the dependencies (see `package.json`)
  * simplified routes definition (FlowRouter based)
  * simplified dynamic page head properties (title, meta, scripts and stylesheets) definition
  * automatic hot-reload of React components
  * PostCSS enabled, Stylus-like syntax is used by default (w/o installing Stylus itself)
  * Google Analytics enabled
  * AgileCRM enabled as the scripts dynamic load example
